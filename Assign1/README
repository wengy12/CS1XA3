-Informs you if you're local repo is up to date with the remote repo
    if everything is up to date
        return "Already up-to-date."
    else
        do "git pull" and make it up to date

-Puts all uncommited changes in a file changes.log
    do "git status" and output redirect to changes.log

-Puts each line from every file of your project with the tag #TODO into a file todo.log
    do "search all files with #TODO" and put the filenames in todo.log

-Checks all haskell files for syntax errors and puts the results into error.log
    do "compile all .hs files" and redirect errors to error.log

//I did use the internet to do all stuffs above, but all of them are just general references and I didn't copy-paste so I believe that it is okay without referenses

-Add at least one feature of your own design
    do "compile all .hs file with special option that will create .tix file every time when you run your haskell code"
    do "read all existing .tix files and put short text report in hpc.log in format "file_path+file_name /n "actual report" " "
    /*
    Actually, doing research about what I can do, I fount something very interesting, called "Haskell program coverage"
    https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_program_coverage#Downloading
    This is powerful tool that tells you a lot about how good is your code
    so first about installation
    if you already have cabal, so just
    >>cabal install hpc
    if not... https://wiki.haskell.org/Cabal-Install <- this will help you
    now it'll install hpc in your local repo
    after this, just run ProjectAnalyse.sh and it'll compile all your FILE.hs into FILE.hs.exe
    every time you run your FILE.hs.exe, it'll automatically create a file FILE.hs.exe.tix in the same directory
    now, you can either run ProjectAnalyse.sh again, it'll do what it has to do (put all code report in file hpc.log)
    or, if you don't want to do it for all files and just want to have your short report on your screen, you can for example use command:
    >>hpc report FILE.hs.exe.tix
    this tool is much more powerful than just give you short report, is also can actually highlight parts in different color in HTML output
    but I cant understand how to open html files on ssh server so I skipped this, but you can try on your own computer
